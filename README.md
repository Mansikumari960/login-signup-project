### Project Description

This project is a full-stack authentication system built with Node.js (Express.js) on the backend and React.js on the frontend.
It provides a simple and secure way for users to sign up, log in, and access protected pages.
 The app demonstrates the basic flow of JWT-based authentication:
1. User registers an account (Signup).
2. User logs in with valid credentials.
3. Backend generates a JWT token and sends it to the frontend.
4. The frontend stores the token in localStorage
5. Protected routes (like Home/Profile) require the token to access.
